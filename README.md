Welcome to LightMHC, a Python framework for predicting peptide-MHC (pMHC) structures using deep
learning. This repository houses the codebase for LightMHC, which is designed for class-I pMHC
prediction with peptide sequences ranging from 8 to 13 amino acids. The
[paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.21.568015v1) associated with this repository
was accepted at the Machine Learning for Structural Biology workshop at the NeurIPS 2023 conference.

## Requirements

This project has the following dependencies:

- Conda
- Python 3.8
- CUDA 11.1 to use a GPU
- PyRosetta license credentials

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine

2. Install the conda environment by running:

```bash
conda create --yes --name lightmhc_env python=3.8
conda env update --name lightmhc_env --file environment.yml
```

If you have a MacOS system or do not have a CUDA-enabled GPU on your laptop, you can install the
CPU-only version with:

```bash
conda create --yes --name lightmhc_env python=3.8
conda env update --name lightmhc_env --file environment_no_gpu.yml
```

3. Install PyRosetta, replacing the placeholders with your own credentials: Linux/Ubuntu operating
   system

```bash
wget https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@conda.graylab.jhu.edu/linux-64/pyrosetta-2021.34+release.5eb89ef-py38_0.tar.bz2
conda activate lightmhc_env
conda install pyrosetta-2021.34+release.5eb89ef-py38_0.tar.bz2
```

MacOS operating system

```bash
wget https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@conda.graylab.jhu.edu/osx-64/pyrosetta-2021.34+release.5eb89ef1fc1-py38_0.tar.bz2
conda activate lightmhc_env
conda install pyrosetta-2021.34+release.5eb89ef1fc1-py38_0.tar.bz2
```

4. Install LightMHC using pip:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

To perform pMHC structure prediction using LightMHC, follow these steps:

1. Prepare a CSV file with the following columns:

- `pdb_id`: The PDB ID of the structure.
- `peptide`: The peptide sequence (8-13 amino acids).
- `mhc`: The MHC sequence (excluding signal peptide residues, e.g., starting at 'GSH').

2. Run the following command, specifying the input CSV path, output directory, and the number of CPU
   cores to use:

```bash
python inference.py data.input_csv_path=YOUR_INPUT_DIR data.output_dir=YOUR_OUTPUT_DIR model.n_cpus=YOUR_CPU_NUMBER
```

## Examples

We have provided an example input CSV file and the resulting structures in the `examples/`
directory.
